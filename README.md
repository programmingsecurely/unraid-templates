# Unraid Templates

This repository contains a collection of random Unraid templates that I have created. These templates can be used to quickly set up various applications on your Unraid server.

## Usage

To use these templates, simply download the XML file for the application you want to install and import it into your Unraid server. For more information on how to do this, please refer to the Unraid documentation.

## Contributing

If you have created your own Unraid templates and would like to contribute them to this repository, please feel free to submit a pull request.
